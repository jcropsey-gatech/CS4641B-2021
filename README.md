### Summary Figure

### Introduction
We will take the rat brain scan data from Allen Institute and create a model that learns how the rat thinks.

### Methods
We will use unsupervised learning method to find the clusters involving the brain signals data that correlates to the images presented.

### Result
The output of the model is a grouping of data points from the rat's brain's photon signals. Thus, given a certain input of brain signal modeled after the rat, we will be able to figure out what it is thinking.

### Discussion
Although a brain reading model raises many ethical questions, it also has great potential in furthering healthcare technology.
